### Optional: Importing Existing Email and Contacts

Some paid email providers allow you to import existing data
such as contacts, calendars, and even historical emails from Gmail
or other providers.

For example, services like **ProtonMail*
offer built-in import tools that can:
- Copy contacts and address books
- Import selected email folders or messages
- Preserve timestamps and basic metadata

This is optional.

Many people choose **not** to import old email at all, especially
when the goal is to reduce historical data exposure or start fresh.
Others import only what they consider essential (e.g., contacts).

**Guidance:**
- Import contacts if you rely on email for coordination
- Be selective with old emails—most value is in accounts, not archives
- Avoid importing marketing or newsletter email
