## Purpose
 This path prioritizes continuity over speed.

## What this means
  - Gmail stays active (temporarily)
  - A paid email account becomes your future default
  - Migration happens over weeks or months

## Typical setup
  - New paid email account (e.g., ProtonMail)
  - Gmail forwards or simply remains monitored
  - New sign-ups use the new address

## Pros
  - Low disruption
  - Easy for non-technical users
  - Reduces anxiety around “missing something”

## Cons
  - Gmail still exists as an identity anchor
  - Migration can stall without discipline

## Who should choose this
  - Executives
  - Busy professionals
  - Anyone who wants safety over speed
