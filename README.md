# Email Sovereignty Playbook

Email is no longer just a communication tool.
It is an identity system, a billing system, a recovery mechanism,
and often the master key to your digital life.

This repository provides **three practical paths** to reduce
dependence on Gmail and reclaim control of your email and data.

You do not need to be technical.
You do not need to self-host a server.
You only need to be intentional.

## The Three Paths

1. **Completely Exit Gmail**
   - Download your data
   - Store it safely
   - Close or abandon the account

2. **Slowly Migrate to a Paid Email Service**
   - Keep Gmail temporarily
   - Transition important accounts over time

3. **Paid Email + Aliases + Rules (Recommended)**
   - Use aliases for accounts and billing
   - Use rules to route or delete email automatically
   - Treat email as a control plane, not an inbox

Each path stands on its own.
You can move between paths as your comfort level grows.

## Who This Is For

- Non-technical users who want clarity and control
- Executives and leaders exploring privacy without disruption
- Technologists who want a clean migration model
- Anyone who wants to stop being the product

## Guiding Principle

> You don’t have to do everything at once.
> You just need to stop doing nothing.
