# Email Sovereignty Playbook

Email is no longer just a communication tool.
It is an identity system, a billing system, a recovery mechanism,
and often the master key to your digital life.

This repository provides **three practical paths** to reduce
dependence on Gmail/Other and reclaim control of your email and data.

You do not need to be technical.
You do not need to self-host a server.
You only need to be intentional.

## The Three Paths

1. **Completely Exit Gmail**
   - Download your data
   - Store it safely
   - Close or abandon the account

2. **Slowly Migrate to a Paid Email Service**
   - Keep Gmail temporarily
   - Transition important accounts over time

3. **Paid Email + Aliases + Rules (Recommended)**
   - Use aliases for accounts and billing
   - Use rules to route or delete email automatically
   - Treat email as a control plane, not an inbox

Each path stands on its own.
You can move between paths as your comfort level grows.

## Who This Is For

- Non-technical users who want clarity and control
- Executives and leaders exploring privacy without disruption
- Technologists who want a clean migration model
- Anyone who wants to stop being the product

## Guiding Principle

> You don’t have to do everything at once.
> You just need to stop doing nothing.

## How to Choose Your Path

## Path Comparison (Plain Language)

| Criteria | Path 1: Exit Gmail | Path 2: Slow Migration | Path 3: Aliases + Rules |
|--------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Effort upfront | High | Low | Medium |
| Disruption | High | Low | Low |
| Control | Very High | Medium | High |
| Ongoing effort | Low (after exit) | Medium | Low |
| Technical comfort needed | Medium | Low | Low |
| Good for non-technical users | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Builds long-term habits | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ |

## How to Read This

- **Path 1** is about certainty and separation  
- **Path 2** is about comfort and gradual change  
- **Path 3** is about balance, agency, and sustainability  

Most people land on **Path 3**, even if they start in Path 2.

---

## A Simple Recommendation

If you’re unsure, start with this:

> **Choose Path 3.**  
> It gives you control without forcing you to give anything up all at once.

You can always:
- Move slower
- Import less
- Change your setup later

Nothing here is permanent except your ability to choose.

## One Last Check

Before deciding, ask yourself:

> “Do I want to optimize for comfort today, or flexibility tomorrow?”

Your answer will usually point you to the right path.
