# Password Managers as Inventories

A password manager is more than a security tool.

It is an **inventory of your digital dependencies**.

## What your password manager already knows

Over time, your password manager accumulates:
- Every service you’ve signed up for
- Which email address you used
- When accounts were created
- Which services still matter

This makes it the best starting point
for any email or identity migration.

## Why this matters during email transitions

When moving away from Gmail or any provider, the hardest part is not email.
It is forgotten accounts.

Your password manager helps you:
- Identify which services use your old email
- Update logins methodically
- Avoid breaking access or recovery flows

Without this inventory, migration becomes guesswork.

## Migration mindset

Do not try to fix everything at once.

Instead:
1. Review saved accounts
2. Update email addresses gradually
3. Prioritize financial and critical services first

Progress beats perfection.

## A quiet benefit

As you migrate, you may discover:
- Services you no longer use
- Accounts that can be closed
- Redundant subscriptions

This is not just a security exercise.
It is digital housekeeping.
