# Importing vs. Starting Fresh

When leaving Gmail or any large email provider, one of the first
questions people ask is:

> “Should I import all my old email and contacts?”

There is no correct answer.
There is only **your comfort level and your goals**.

What matters most is that **you decide**, not the platform.

## Why this decision matters

Email holds years of:
- Conversations
- Receipts
- Accounts
- Personal history

Moving email is not just technical.
It is emotional and psychological.

Some people want continuity.
Others want a clean break.

Both choices are valid.

## Option 1: Importing existing data

Some paid email providers allow you to import:
- Contacts
- Address books
- Calendars
- Selected email folders

This can help if:
- You rely heavily on email history
- You want minimal disruption
- You are transitioning slowly

### Benefits of importing
- Familiarity
- Reduced anxiety about “losing something”
- Easier short-term transition

### Tradeoffs
- You bring old data into a new system
- More data means more responsibility
- Historical email may no longer be useful, but still exists

Importing prioritizes **continuity**.

## Option 2: Starting fresh

Starting fresh means:
- Not importing old email
- Possibly importing only contacts
- Treating your new mailbox as a new chapter

This can help if:
- You want to reduce historical data exposure
- You feel overwhelmed by old email
- You want stronger boundaries going forward

### Benefits of starting fresh
- Less data to manage
- Lower long-term risk
- Clear separation from the past

### Tradeoffs
- You may need to re-establish some contacts
- Old email will not be searchable in your new system
- It can feel uncomfortable at first

Starting fresh prioritizes **clarity and control**.

---

## A common middle ground

Many people choose a hybrid approach:
- Import contacts
- Do **not** import old email
- Keep an offline archive of past email if needed

This approach:
- Preserves important relationships
- Reduces live data exposure
- Keeps history available without keeping it active

---

## This is about agency, not purity

Data sovereignty does not mean:
- Doing everything perfectly
- Cutting ties overnight
- Becoming highly technical

It means:
- Making intentional choices
- Understanding tradeoffs
- Retaining the ability to change later

You can:
- Import now and clean up later
- Start fresh and revisit old data if needed
- Change your mind as your comfort grows

The key point is simple:

> Your email works for you.
> You are not working for your email.

---

## One guiding question

Before importing anything, ask:

> “Does this data still serve me?”

If the answer is no, you do not owe it a new home.
