# Email as Identity

For most people, email is not just a way to send messages.

It is the **master key** to your digital life.

## What email actually controls

Your email address is commonly used for:
- Account creation
- Password resets
- Security alerts
- Billing and receipts
- Legal and financial records
- Identity verification

If someone controls your email, they can often:
- Reset passwords to other services
- Lock you out of accounts
- Access sensitive personal or financial data

This is why email should be treated as **infrastructure**, not convenience.

## The hidden risk of “free” email

Free email services are designed to scale, not to protect your identity.
Even if the content of your email is private, metadata often is not.

Metadata includes:
- Who you communicate with
- How often
- From where
- At what times

Over time, this creates a detailed behavioral profile.

## Reframing email

Instead of thinking:
> “This is my inbox”

Think:
> “This is my identity control plane”

Once you adopt this mindset, decisions about providers, aliases, rules,
and migration become much clearer.

You don’t need to be technical.
You just need to be intentional.
