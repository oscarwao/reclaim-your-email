 # Aliases Explained

Aliases are not extra inboxes.

They are **identity firewalls**.

## What is an email alias?

An alias is an alternate email address that delivers mail
to the same mailbox.

Example:
- yourname@provider.com (primary)
- billing@provider.com (alias)
- subscriptions@provider.com (alias)

All email still arrives in one place, but **how it arrives matters**.

## Why aliases matter

Aliases allow you to:
- Separate personal communication from accounts and bills
- Reduce tracking across services
- Contain spam or data leaks
- Disable one alias without affecting others

If an alias is leaked or abused, you can turn it off.
Your core identity remains intact.

## Common alias categories

Many people start with:
- Accounts (logins and security alerts)
- Billing (utilities, invoices, receipts)
- Subscriptions (newsletters, paid services)
- One-off vendors (optional, higher privacy)

You do not need dozens of aliases.
A few well-chosen ones go a long way.

## Aliases are about control, not complexity

Aliases are not for “organizing email.”
They are for **limiting blast radius**.

Think of them the same way organizations separate systems:
- One failure should not compromise everything.
