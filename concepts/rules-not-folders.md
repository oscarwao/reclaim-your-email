# Rules, Not Folders

Folders are manual.
Rules are governance.

## The problem with folders

Folders rely on you to:
- Read every message
- Decide where it goes
- Maintain discipline over time

This works at low volume.
It fails quietly as volume grows.

## What rules do differently

Rules automate decisions based on:
- Sender
- Recipient (including aliases)
- Keywords
- Message type

Once set, rules:
- Route email automatically
- Reduce inbox noise
- Enforce consistency

You don’t need to “stay on top of email.”
The system does it for you.

## Example rule patterns

- Bills → Bills folder
- Subscriptions → Subscriptions folder
- Marketing → auto-delete
- Account alerts → Accounts folder

Rules are not about neatness.
They are about **reducing attention cost**.

## Why this matters for sovereignty

Every unnecessary email you read:
- Increases cognitive load
- Normalizes surveillance-driven communication
- Trains you to react instead of decide

Rules help you reclaim time and agency.

Automation is not laziness.
It is boundaries, encoded.
