## Purpose
 This path balances control, privacy, and usability.
It is the most transferable model for organizations and leaders.

## Core idea
  You keep one primary mailbox, but never give it out.
  Instead, you use aliases for different purposes.

## Example alias strategy
  - billing@yourmail.com
  - accounts@yourmail.com
  - subscriptions@yourmail.com
  - Vendor-specific aliases (optional)

## Rules as automation
  Rules are not about neatness.
  They are about control.
  
  Examples:
  - Bills → Bills folder\
  - Subscriptions → Subscriptions folder
  - Marketing → auto-delete
  - Account alerts → Accounts folder

## Why this works
- Limits tracking
- Prevents inbox overload
- Makes account compromise easier to contain
- Prepares you for future self-hosting if desired

## Password manager dependency (important)
  Your password manager becomes:
    - A list of services using Gmail
    - A checklist for migration
    - A recovery safety net

 ## Pros
  - Strong privacy posture
  - Minimal disruption
  - Scales from personal → professional use

## Cons
  - Requires discipline up front
  - Requires paying for email

## Who should choose this
  - Most people
  - Leaders modeling good digital hygiene
  - Anyone planning deeper sovereignty later

## Concepts (plain-language explainers)
  You’ll want these short files to prevent confusion:
  - email-as-identity.md
    - Why email is the master key to your digital life
  - aliases-explained.md
    - Aliases are not “extra inboxes”—they’re identity firewalls
  - rules-not-folders.md
    - Why automation beats manual sorting
  - password-managers-as-inventories.md
    - Your password manager is a map of your digital dependencies
