##Purpose (plain language)

This path is for people who want a clean break from Gmail and are willing to accept some inconvenience for maximum control.

# What this means

 - You stop using Gmail entirely
 - You download and store your data
 - You either delete the account or leave it dormant

## High-level steps (non-technical)

  1. Download all Gmail data using Google Takeout
  2. Store it securely (encrypted drive, offline storage)
  3. Update critical accounts with a new email
  4. Close or abandon Gmail

## Pros

  - Maximum separation from Google
  - No ongoing data generation
  - Clear psychological and technical boundary

## Cons

  - Easy to miss forgotten accounts
  - Some services assume Gmail-based recovery

## Who should choose this
